# NovaCart – Full Stack E-Commerce Web Application
NovaCart is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application built using  
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), and Node.js (Backend Setup).

This project demonstrates frontend architecture, state management, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and basic backend initialization.
